# Face Detection from Scratch

Welcome to the **Face Detection from Scratch** project! This repository demonstrates how to build a face detection model step by step, using foundational machine learning techniques and popular libraries.

## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to implement a face detection system from scratch. It focuses on:
- Data preprocessing and annotation.
- Building and training a model for face detection.
- Evaluating the model's performance.

## 🛠️ Features
- Custom dataset preparation using tools like `labelme`.
- Model training with `TensorFlow`.
- Image processing using `OpenCV`.
- Data augmentation using `Albumentations`.
- Visualization of results using `matplotlib`.

Will upload them all soon, as they are bigger than 25 MB! so need some time to figure it out.
```

## 🚀 Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/risheeee/Face_Detection_From_Scratch.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory and install required libraries:
   ```bash
   cd Face_Detection_From_Scratch
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   Or manually install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install labelme tensorflow opencv-python matplotlib albumentations
   ```

3. Run the Jupyter notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

4. Open `face_detection.ipynb` to explore the code.

## 📜 Steps to Execute
1. **Data Annotation**: Annotate the images in the dataset using `labelme`.
2. **Preprocessing**: Preprocess the dataset (resize, augment, and normalize images).
3. **Model Training**: Train the detection model using the annotated dataset.
4. **Evaluation**: Test the model on unseen data and visualize the results.
